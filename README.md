# 🌍 LivWell – Smart Livability Index

LivWell is an AI-powered web application that predicts whether a location is suitable for living using environmental data, nearby facilities, machine learning, and recommendations for better nearby areas.

It is designed for **citizens**, **urban planners**, and **hackathon-level smart city decision systems**.

# 🛠️ How to Run the Project in VS Code

Follow these steps carefully:

---

## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/livewell.git
cd livewell
```

---

## 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```
This creates a folder called `venv`.

---

## 3️⃣ Activate Virtual Environment

### 🪟 Windows (PowerShell)

```bash
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 🪟 Windows (CMD)

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### 🍎 Mac/Linux

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

After activation, you should see `(venv)` in your terminal.

---

## 4️⃣ Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 5️⃣ Add API Keys (Environment Variables – Recommended)

### 🪟 Windows PowerShell

```bash
$env:GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"
$env:OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"
```

### 🍎 Mac/Linux

```bash
export GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"
export OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"
```

This keeps your keys safe and avoids uploading them to GitHub.

---

## 6️⃣ Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

You should see:

```
Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

---

## 7️⃣ Open in Browser

Open:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

Your application will run successfully 🎉

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Ensure `model.pkl` exists in the root directory.
- Do NOT upload `venv/` folder to GitHub.
- API keys must be set before running.
- Nearby Good Areas are based on dataset/model predictions (recommended areas may differ from real-time AQI facilities).
